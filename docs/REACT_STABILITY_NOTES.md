# React Stability & Deduplication Notes

## Current Configuration Status ✅

**React Versions**
- react: ^18.3.1 (caret allows patch updates)
- react-dom: 18.3.1 (exact version)
- Both versions are stable React 18 line

**Vite Deduplication** (Already Optimal)
```javascript
resolve: {
  dedupe: ["react","react-dom","react-dom/client","react/jsx-runtime","react/jsx-dev-runtime"]
},
optimizeDeps: { 
  include: ["react","react-dom","react-dom/client"],
  exclude: ["@radix-ui/react-toast"] 
}
```

**Toast Provider Status**
- Currently using SafeToastProvider hotfix
- Original Radix ToastProvider temporarily bypassed
- No React "useState of null" crashes observed

## Production Deployment Readiness

✅ **Single React Instance**: Vite dedupe ensures single React copy  
✅ **Optimized Dependencies**: React packages pre-bundled by Vite  
✅ **Runtime Stability**: SafeToastProvider prevents crashes  
✅ **Build Consistency**: Exact react-dom version locks core functionality  

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Test Radix Revert**: Try reverting to original ToastProvider after React deduplication verification
2. **Lock React Version**: Remove caret prefix if strict version control needed
3. **Monitor Analytics**: Track any React-related errors in production
