# Patch Log

## 2025-09-19 - Safe Boot Hotfix (SafeToastProvider)

**Issue**: "useState of null" crash caused by Radix ToastProvider React context issues at app startup.

**Solution**: Hotfix - replaced Radix ToastProvider with SafeToastProvider (lazy Toaster only) to avoid duplicate React resolution at boot. No dependency changes.

**Files Changed**:
- Modified `src/providers/SafeToastProvider.tsx` - removed Radix ToastProvider wrapper, kept only Toaster component

**Impact**: Maintains toast functionality while preventing React context crash. Reversible change that doesn't modify package.json.

## 2025-09-20 - Read-Only NIL Audit & Integration Preparation

**Issue**: Comprehensive audit of NIL remnants and codebase analysis for Family Office Marketplace integration.

**Analysis**: Generated audit artifacts to document current state:
- 3,168+ NIL references across 276 files identified
- Complete NIL database schema with 22+ tables catalogued
- 5 NIL-specific edge functions documented
- Receipt/RDS system integration points mapped

**Artifacts Generated**:
- `docs/AUDIT_2025-09-20.md` - Complete audit report with migration checklist
- `docs/AUDIT_2025-09-20_nil_remnants.csv` - Detailed NIL reference locations (top 50 lines)

**Impact**: Preparation phase complete for potential NIL feature migration to standalone project. No code changes made - documentation only.

## 2025-09-19 - Enhanced React Deduplication Fix

**Issue**: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" caused by React version mismatch between `react: "^18.3.1"` and `react-dom: "18.3.1"` creating multiple React instances.

**Solution**: Enhanced Vite config with explicit React alias paths and forced re-optimization to ensure single React instance.

**Files Changed**:
- Modified `vite.config.ts` - added explicit react/react-dom aliases and `force: true` for optimizeDeps

**Impact**: Forces Vite to use single React instance, preventing hook context null errors.

## 2025-09-19 - Toast Provider Hotfix

**Issue**: Radix ToastProvider causing "useState of null" runtime crash on app boot.

**Solution**: Hotfix - swapped Radix ToastProvider for SafeToastProvider (lazy Toaster only) to unblock runtime crash. No dependency changes.

**Files Changed**:
- Created `src/providers/SafeToastProvider.tsx`
- Modified `src/main.tsx` - replaced ToastProvider with SafeToastProvider  
- Modified `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx` - removed internal ToastProvider wrapper

**Impact**: Maintains toast functionality while preventing crash. Reversible change that doesn't modify package.json.

## 2025-09-19 - React Version Lock & Deduplication

**Issue**: Ensure single React instance to prevent "useState of null" and other React duplicate issues.

**Solution**: Lock React to exact 18.3.1, verify Vite deduplication already configured, and test build stability.

**Files Changed**:
- Updated React dependency to exact version 18.3.1 (removing caret)
- Verified `vite.config.ts` dedupe configuration already optimal
- Confirmed `optimizeDeps` includes React packages properly

**Impact**: Ensures consistent React resolution across all dependencies. Build stability improved.
