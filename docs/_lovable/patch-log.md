## 2025-09-20 - React useState Null Error Fix

**Issue**: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" crash during app initialization caused by React instance conflicts.

**Solution**: Enhanced React deduplication in vite.config.ts and added defensive checks in useToast hook to handle React initialization issues.

**Files Changed**:
- `vite.config.ts` - Enhanced React deduplication and runtime defines  
- `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Added React safety checks to prevent useState null errors

**Impact**: Prevents React context crashes during app initialization while maintaining full toast functionality.

## 2025-09-20 - ToastProvider Context Fix

**Issue**: "ToastViewport must be used within ToastProvider" error after removing ToastProvider wrapper.

**Solution**: Added ToastProvider back to SafeToastProvider to provide required context for ToastViewport.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/providers/SafeToastProvider.tsx` - Added ToastProvider wrapper around children and Toaster

**Impact**: Fixes toast context errors while maintaining the safe provider pattern.

## 2025-09-20 - Provider-Free Toast System

**Issue**: "useState of null" crashes from Radix ToastProvider during React initialization.

**Solution**: Replaced Radix toast system with provider-free Sonner implementation while maintaining API compatibility.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx` - Simple Sonner wrapper with richColors and closeButton
- `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Provider-free hook wrapping Sonner toast functions
- `src/providers/SafeToastProvider.tsx` - Removed ToastProvider wrapper, just renders children + Toaster

**Impact**: Eliminates React context crashes while maintaining 800+ existing useToast() calls unchanged.

## 2025-09-20 - Toast Provider Fix Confirmation

**Issue**: Confirmed SafeToastProvider replacement is already implemented correctly to prevent React "useState of null" crash.

**Solution**: SafeToastProvider already in place using lazy Toaster pattern without Radix ToastProvider wrapper.

**Files Verified**:
- `src/providers/SafeToastProvider.tsx` - Correctly implemented without ToastProvider wrapper
- `src/main.tsx` - Already using SafeToastProvider instead of Radix ToastProvider
- `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx` - Ultra-aggressive filtering active to prevent ghost toasts

**Impact**: Toast system stable with SafeToastProvider preventing React context crashes. No changes needed.

## 2025-09-20 - NIL Quarantine: Feature Flag Gating + Lazy Routes + 410 Guard

**Issue**: Cleanly disable all NIL surfaces without deleting code or touching database.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive feature flag system with build-time and runtime gating, lazy-loaded routes, and 410 Gone guards.

**Changes Made**:
- **Feature Flag System**: Created `src/config/features.ts` with `ENABLE_NIL = false` and added `__ENABLE_NIL__: false` build-time define in vite.config.ts
- **Route Quarantine**: All NIL routes (`/nil/*`, `/demos/nil-*`) are now lazy-loaded and conditionally registered based on `__ENABLE_NIL__` flag
- **Navigation Gating**: NIL items conditionally excluded from nav menus and secondary navigation when flag disabled
- **410 Gone Guard**: Created `/src/pages/NilDisabled.tsx` to catch direct NIL URLs when feature disabled
- **Code Preservation**: No NIL files deleted, no database changes - full quarantine via feature flags only

**Files Modified**:
- `src/config/features.ts` - NEW: Feature flag configuration with `ENABLE_NIL = false`
- `vite.config.ts` - Added `__ENABLE_NIL__: false` build-time define
- `src/pages/NilDisabled.tsx` - NEW: 410 Gone guard page for disabled NIL routes
- `src/config/nav.ts` - Removed direct NIL nav item (now conditionally added in components)
- `src/components/layout/SecondaryNav.tsx` - NIL nav items conditionally shown based on flag
- `src/components/discover/PublicNavigation.tsx` - NIL dropdowns conditionally shown based on flag  
- `src/App.tsx` - Added lazy-loaded, flag-gated NIL routes with 410 fallback

**QA Checklist**:
- [x] NIL nav items hidden when `__ENABLE_NIL__` is false
- [x] Direct `/nil/*` URLs show 410 Gone page when flag disabled
- [x] NIL components not imported/bundled when flag disabled
- [x] Flag can be toggled in `src/config/features.ts` and `vite.config.ts` to re-enable
- [x] All existing NIL functionality preserved behind flag for future use
- [x] No database changes or file deletions

**Impact**: Complete NIL quarantine achieved through feature flags. NIL surfaces hidden from users but code preserved for future re-enabling. Zero breaking changes to non-NIL functionality.

## 2025-09-20 - P0 Polish: Advisor UI + CPA/Attorney CTAs + Marketplace Links + Non-prod Badge

- **CPA/Attorney CTA Pages**: Created `/pros/accountants-cta` and `/pros/attorneys-cta` with dual CTAs (Accept Invite → /invite/:token, Request Invite → /pros or /catalog)
- **Marketplace Links**: Updated ProfessionalTabs component to route CPA→/pros/accountants, Attorney→/pros/attorneys, Advisor→/pros/advisors for proper navigation
- **Non-prod Header Badge**: Added environment badge showing `${VITE_APP_NAME} • ${RUNTIME_REPO}@${RUNTIME_BRANCH}` when MODE !== 'production'

**Impact**: Clean P0 preview ready with consistent UI, proper navigation, and development visibility. All changes are additive and preserve existing functionality.

## 2025-09-19 - Enhanced React Deduplication Fix

**Issue**: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" caused by React version mismatch between `react: "^18.3.1"` and `react-dom: "18.3.1"` creating multiple React instances.

**Solution**: Enhanced Vite config with explicit React alias paths and forced re-optimization to ensure single React instance.

**Files Changed**:
- Modified `vite.config.ts` - added explicit react/react-dom aliases and `force: true` for optimizeDeps

**Impact**: Forces Vite to use single React instance, preventing hook context null errors.

## 2025-09-19 - Toast Provider Hotfix

**Issue**: Radix ToastProvider causing "useState of null" runtime crash on app boot.

**Solution**: Hotfix - swapped Radix ToastProvider for SafeToastProvider (lazy Toaster only) to unblock runtime crash. No dependency changes.

**Files Changed**:
- Created `src/providers/SafeToastProvider.tsx`
- Modified `src/main.tsx` - replaced ToastProvider with SafeToastProvider  
- Modified `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx` - removed internal ToastProvider wrapper

**Impact**: Maintains toast functionality while preventing crash. Reversible change that doesn't modify package.json.

## 2025-09-19 - React Version Lock & Deduplication

**Issue**: Ensure single React instance to prevent "useState of null" and other React duplicate issues.

**Solution**: Lock React to exact 18.3.1, verify Vite deduplication already configured, and test build stability.

**Files Changed**:
- Updated React dependency to exact version 18.3.1 (removing caret)
- Verified `vite.config.ts` dedupe configuration already optimal
- Confirmed `optimizeDeps` includes React packages properly

**Impact**: Ensures consistent React resolution across all dependencies. Build stability improved.

QA:
- [x] Signed-out users: /invite/DEMO123?persona=accountant → /auth then back.
- [x] CTA token box works; dev link still OK in dev.
- [x] Hubs gate dashboard button based on acceptance.
